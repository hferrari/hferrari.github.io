Some time ago I bought an old turntable to start exploring the vinyl world. It was functional, but the acrylic
cover was really showing its age.

I first wet sanded both sides of the cover. I started on 600 grid, followed by 800, 1200, 2500 and finally 3000. It was
not easy to find these to purchase, so I ordered it online.

After sanding, I used automotive polishing compound on both sides, together with a cheap rotating cloth attached to my 
drill.

Some small regions of the acrylic had what looked like internal defects. I am pretty sure those appeared over the years,
and were not manufacturing issues. Anyway, they were not removed, but the yellow color and even deep scratches were gone.

The most challenging part by far was to come up with a way to secure the acrylic cover while polishing it with the drill.
I used a Makita 700W drill, so it was quite heavy and hard to controll. Adding to that, the cover is big and breaks 
easily, it also has a very nonuniform format and has just been wet sanded up to 3000, all of which makes it hard to 
hadle.

The solution I found was quite cumbersome: I ended up putting it over a towel on the flor, and holding it with my feet
against the wall, while the hands were operating the drill. Definately not ideal, but it worked in the end.

Final thoughts:

+ It was definately worth the effort, it took an afternoon and the result is impressive.
+ The rotating cloth used, attached to a drill, is not the optimal solution. A grinder with a polishing disk would
  have made my life much easier.
+ It was impossible to polish the internal corners because the radious of the disk in the drill was to big. If I
  had a Dremel that problem would be solved. One can see on the after pictures that the corners are not as 
  transparent as the flat regions.
