Last time I moved I got an unfurnished appartment (great pottential for DIY improvements \o/)

![First ever night]({{ site.base_url }}/assets/first_night.jpg) *Camping at home*

My bedroom was basically floor and walls, so the first step was of course get a proper bed. After that I lived for some
 months without any issues, but it was not comfortable:
+ I didn't like the sticker on the wall
+ I had to get up everytime I wanted to switch the lights
+ There were no easy places to leave my phone charging near by

All in all, it seemed like an opportunity to improve life by DIYing, so I started planning on building a headboard, with
AC sockets and integrated lighting.

I really like the look and feel of wood, so I went into that direction. I decided to use cedar slats, the ones that have
joinery on the sides. These are usually used for roofing, but they worked very well in my application.

The problem with this material is that it only sells on a few different lenghts, and in packages of big quantities (at 
least for a small projct like this)

The smallest lenght I could find was 2.5m, which worked nice for me, because I could cut it in half and have 1.25m, that
works great as a headboard. It is extra work, but doable. Also, the minimum quantity in the package was enought to
barely cover the wall. After cutting everything, only half slat would be left after the work was done. 

Having no spare material is never good. If I messed a single piece, I would have to buy another big package to use 
almost nothing of it. Considering the cost of the cedar alone was like 80% of the total cost, this raised the stress of
 the project to unconfortable levels, and I was still just planning....

Anyway, I decided to take the risk and ordered the material, I also bought the electrical components, like wires, 
switches and AC sockets, LED strip and power supply, wire terminals...

I first started by cutting and fixing to the wall three 5x5 cm studs. They served as support for the cedar slats, but
also as spacers for the electrical components.

 LEDs and AC sockets*

still missing sanding and finishing to the wood*

Up to here it was hard work already, specially without proper tools. The only electrical tool I had was the drill, 
everything else was manually done, from individually cutting the wood to nailing the boards.

Something that ended up being a challenge was the holes for the switches and AC sockets, because they had to be squares.
I start with a circular hole made with the drill, but had to continue by hand filing. A Dremel would had made my
life so much easier here (again...). Also, attentious ones can see I messed the height of the holes. The position 
between the left and right sides are not horizontally alligned, that is part of doing stuff yourself.

After sanding I applied three coats of natural stain, and that really made the wood grain shine.

Final thoughts:
+ I really liked the end result, it made the bedroom much more cozy and functional. Looking back now, I am really proud
of this project
+ If it ever needs maintence on electrical components, something that would require me to open the headboard, I would 
have a big challenge ahead, but that is a problem for future me. It is going strong for two years now.
+ I use just the headboard LED light almost all the time. The ceiling light is to bright and it is just used for 
cleaning or looking for missing stuff... When just chilling out, the indirect lights in the headboard are perfect.
+ I bought a very cheap LED strip that was sold as warm 2700K light, I doubt it, it is definetaly too white.
+ It was harder work than I anticipated, I really felt the need for proper tools on this one. If I remember correctly
it took me three days to finish the project.
