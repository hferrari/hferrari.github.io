I needed a small table at home, specially for when there are visitors around. 

At first I didn't bother having one because I thought It would rarely see any use and make daily cleaning harder.

My girlfriend and my mother always argued I should have one, but they never managed to convince me. That is when my 
girlfriend suggested I could try to build a foldable table myself, and it could be put aside when not in use. 
She is a smart one and played with my DIY feelings haha

I liked the idea immediately and started planning. I did some research to get inspiration, and in no time I was taking 
measurements and buying the necessary material.

board*

I also took the opportunity that a new project was about to start and bought a DeWalt jig saw.

both pendular and orbital action*

I started by cutting all the pieces and fully assembled it before applying anything to the wood. I wanted to be sure it
works before spending time sanding and painting.

I fixed two 5x5cm studs to the wall. The table top was then fixed to the lower one with big hinges that I bought online.

The legs are fixed using foldable angle braces that I also bought online. Those feature a locking mechanism, so that 
once it opens, it won't close again unless one presses the hidden locking tabs. 

That is a critical safety feature, I was afraid someone would accidentaly kick the leg and close it, making the top to 
fall down. That would ruin the dinner....

When the table is folded, I added a small lock that keeps the table top fixed to the upper stud, avoiding it to fall.

After the concept was proven, I applied two coats of natural stain to the wood.

![Oppened Table]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/foldable_table_03.jpg) *Two adults can sit comfortably, the third place...
well... It was carefully designed for children*

Final thoughts:

* Jig saw is definately not made for straight cuts, but with care and patience it is possible.
* I should buy an electrical sander with dust collection, sanding where you live is not smart.
* It took me two days to complete the building, including drying time.
* I spent around R$350,00 on wood and the metal parts. The wood stain I already had, and the screws came from the
 "leftovers-from-past-projects-box".
* My mother and girlfriend were correct, the table is very useful and I should have build it sooner. It is in open
 position most of the time, and I started using it a lot. 
 When it is cleaning time, I fold it in 2 seconds and it basically disappears.
* No regrets on going the DIY way on this, it was a simple fun project, not stressful and it fits perfectly, optimizing
 the space.
* I am really happy on how it turned out and think it looks great.
